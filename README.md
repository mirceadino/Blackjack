# Blackjack

Web app made in Python to play Blackjack against the AI dealer (December 2015). <br/><br/>
It initiates a session of Blackjack games and also keeps a scoreboard by tracking player's wins and dealer's wins.
I used <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> and <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> frameworks. The pictures of the game cards are from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck">Wikipedia</a>.<br/>
Disclaimer: I don't know the full rules for Blackjack, I did a simplified variant :-)<br/>
